# Superstore Sales Analysis – Excel Project

This repository contains my Excel-based analysis of Superstore sales data.  
The work includes cleaning the raw data, preparing a structured dataset, building pivot tables for analysis, and creating a final dashboard that highlights important business insights.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project was to understand sales performance across different product categories, regions, and customer segments.  
I cleaned the dataset, created KPIs, analyzed trends using pivot tables, and designed a dashboard that summarizes the results in a clear and simple format.

## Data Cleaning Summary

The following steps were completed during the cleaning process:

## Analysis Performed

The analysis mainly uses Pivot Tables to explore:

- Sales by category and sub-category  
- Profit and loss patterns  
- Sales by region and state  
- Shipment modes  
- Quantity and discount patterns  
- Year-wise trends  

These tables formed the base of the dashboard.

## Key Insights

Some observations from the analysis:

- Technology products generate strong sales compared to other categories.  
- Furniture has high sales but inconsistent profit margins.  
- Certain sub-categories, such as Office Furnishing, show lower profitability.  
- Regular Air is the most frequently used shipping mode.  
- Higher discounts often lead to lower profit percentages.

These insights can help in pricing, sales strategy, and inventory planning.
